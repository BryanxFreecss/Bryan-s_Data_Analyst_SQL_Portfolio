# Introduction

Hello! My name is Bryan I began my career as a Data Analyst around a year ago. I am thankful for the opportunity to learn more and continually improve my skills.

## Goals

The primary purpose of this repository is to showcase my analytics skills. I am eager to build a portfolio that not only highlights my abilities but also opens up new opportunities for growth and collaboration.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or potential collaborations in mind!

Thank you for visiting!
