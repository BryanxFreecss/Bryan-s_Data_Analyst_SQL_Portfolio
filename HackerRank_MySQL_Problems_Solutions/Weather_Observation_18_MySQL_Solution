/* Question */
Consider P1(a,b) and P2(a,b) to be two points on a 2D plane.

a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
a happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

/* Answer */
SELECT ROUND(ABS(MAX(LAT_N) - MIN(LAT_N)) + ABS(MAX(LONG_W) - MIN(LONG_W)), 4)
FROM STATION;
